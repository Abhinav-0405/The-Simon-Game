# The Simon Game

## Description
The Simon Game is a classic memory-based game where players must replicate a sequence of colors generated by the computer. The sequence gets longer with each correct response, making the game progressively more challenging.

## Features
- Randomly generated color sequences
- User interaction through mouse clicks
- Sound effects for each color press
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect responses
- Progressive difficulty with increasing sequences

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. The game will start by showing a color in the sequence.
3. Click the corresponding color button to repeat the sequence.
4. If correct, a new color is added to the sequence.
5. If incorrect, the game ends, and you can restart.
